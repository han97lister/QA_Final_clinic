## Brief
### Project Brief

This project is a group challenge to work to a deliverable with time constraints, providing a robust deployment with consistent method and CI pipeline.
A monthly estimate of cost should be made for the projects, risks should be assessed and issues and improvements discussed. We should implement a Webhook with GitSCM to enable rolling updates when code is pushed to the repository. We should justify our usage of chosen technologies; and provide multiple environment support for both testing and live.

### Our Approach

As a group, we decided to choose roles based on our strengths so that everyone felt able to contribute equally towards this project. Our goal was to implement deployment for the pet clinic app and we thought that main areas to focus on would be building the infrastructure with Terraform, containerising with Docker,  building a multi-stage pipeline script with Jenkins, and deploying with Kubernetes. Therefore, Josh managed Terraform, Isaac focused on Docker, I scripted the Jenkins Pipeline and Alex managed Kubernetes.  In terms of working in an agile and scrum manor, we believed us all to be part of the development team and also business analysts. As project manager, Isaac was in charge of estimating costs and assessing risks. I ensured we worked in an agile way as Scrum Manager by maintaining the Kanban Board which was organised into sprints for each day. We also held sprint retrospective meetings which allowed us to inspect the last sprint, identifying the positives and negatives and thus clarify the plan for that day. Alex was the Product Owner as he was the main instrigater in ensuring our app deployed successfully.

## Designs
### Basic Designs
Here is our CI pipeline:
![pipeline][pipeline]
_Our CI Pipeline_

**Kanban Board: Trello**  \
Trello was used as a Kanban board for this project. It allows for 'cards' containing user stories and the product backlog, in addition to basic risks and issues assessment. Cards can be colour coded to aggregate their importance by story points or to demarcate the position of the task in the MOSCOW prioritisation.

![trello][trello]

**Version Control: Git VCS**  \
Git VCS was used for version control of this project. It permits a push/pull relationship between virtual machine and repository for portability; allows branching for rolling updates, and can be polled by Jenkins build triggers via a webhook. This ensures that changes to the code are updated on the live application as quickly as possible.

**CI Server: Jenkins**  \
Jenkins was used as a CI Server for this project. Jenkins creates project builds from a multi-stage pipeline script, and checks for updates to the source code in the Git repository. In the instance, we decided to install dependencies at the start of the pipeline, initialize Terraform to build infrastructure so that we could subsequently test, build and deploy. Here is a screenshot for our application successfully deploying:  
![jpipeline][jpipeline]

**Cloud Server: Microsoft Azure**  \
Azure is a cloud platform for building, managing and deploying services. It is useful due to how diversifiable and flexible it is. With Azure, you can add capabilities to your existing network in a Platform as a Service (PaaS) capacity, or have Azure as the starting point for your network infrastructure as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). We have chosen the latter approach as a fully Azure based deployment is easier to cost due to Azure's accessible pricing systems. Azure also offers good advice in terms of cost management, ideal for tech startups.

**Image builds: Docker Compose**  \
Docker Compose was used to build images for use with Kubernetes in this project. Because Docker produces methodical and consistent image builds, which can be pushed to its in-house image repository (Dockerhub) Docker images built and pushed with docker-compose are the perfect foil for a Kubernetes pod.

**Infrastructure Management: Terraform**  \
Terraform was used to create and modify the infrastructure of the project. Provisioning and automating the infrastructure allows for more efficient delivery of software aligned with the DevOps methodology. In the case of this project, Terraform provisions the Kubernetes cluster, its associated node; and the Azure resource group.

**Orchestration Tool: Kubernetes**   \
Kubernetes is the most fully realised orchestration tool on the market, making it preferable to Docker Swarm as it is 'aware' of aspects of the project beyond the life cycle of the container and has a more fully fleshed out set of control commands. In our project, we use discrete YAML manifests for our MySQL pod, NGINX load balancer, Angular front-end and REST API back-end, as this enables a complete and uncluttered configuration and orchestration, making issue diagnoses easier.

**Reverse Proxy: NGINX**  \
NGINX reverse proxies perform load balancing. This assists with the distribution of requests across backend servers (such as within the Kubernetes pods). If one server goes down, NGINX will reroute requests to a different server in accordance with the routing policy. Serving the application to the HTTP port 80 of an NGINX machine means that all other pods can have limits set such that they can't be communicated with externally.


Here is a more in-depth view of our Kubernetes Cluster configuration, from an end user perspective:
![cluster][cluster]  \
_Configuration of a K8s cluster_  
The cluster diagram illustrates how all traffic is directed towards our NGINX load balancer and reverse proxy in order to delegate accordingly to our front-end and back-end pods which are able to store data within the MySQL database. 

### Risk Assessment

We have performed a full risk assessment before attempting deployment. Those risks which are not currently mitigated and require revisiting will be revisited after deployment.
A link to our risk assessment (pre-revisit) is available in the Resources section.
Unfortunately, we were not able to action a PersistentVolume or obscure exposed secrets in the Kubernetes YAML when we revisited the risk assessment.

Please find a screenshot below:

If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:

  sudo usermod -aG docker your-user

Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!

WARNING: Adding a user to the "docker" group will grant the ability to run
         containers which can be used to obtain root privileges on the
         docker host.

[0m[1m[32mTerraform has been successfully initialized![0m[32m[0m
[0m[32m
You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.[0m

[0m[1m[32mNo changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.[0m[32m

This means that Terraform did not detect any differences between your
configuration and real physical resources that exist. As a result, no
actions need to be performed.[0m

### Known Issues

Kubernetes cluster required a _rollout restart_ of the deployment to run all pods successfully and deploy.
Our secrets are currently exposed in the MySQL Kubernetes YAML manifest. Steps will be taken to secure these in line with the risk assessment.
Docker images are presently not versioned, so emergency rollbacks to a former version would be difficult to accurately perform.


### Future Improvements

Versioning of images for easy rollback to previous versions. Could be done with an IMAGE_NUMBER variable, for example, which increments on each image build.
We haven't executed end-to-end tests in this project (with Protractor) we have only executed unit tests with Karma, so testing coverage is not too optimal at present.
Some dependencies have been removed from our dependencies.sh as we had to manually install them in troubleshooting. 
Automating these dependencies is important for the robustness of future deployments.
A permanent DNS name as at present automated kubectl commands cause the load balancer IP to change upon deployment.

### Expenses

To calculate expenses, we used the Azure pricing calculator.
The costed components of our project are:

**1x Ubuntu Linux VM of size Standard D2s_v3**: £63.15 per month*  \
**1x Azure Kubernetes Cluster node of size Standard D2s_v3**: £63.11 per month*

*where a month is defined as a 730 hour period

**Total Cost** £126.26 per month

To improve costs, we could reserve the VM for a year (saving up to 37% in the process) once we were sure of demand and storage needs (as opposed to PAYG)
Right-sizing the Kubernetes pods to ensure they have limits preventing them from consuming too many resources and scaling back on VM size as necessary could also save money.

Here is a screenshot of the costing breakdown on Azure:

### Version Control

For a diligent solution to this project, we operated within a feature-branch model, with each branch pertaining to a particular component software utilised within the project.
Our branches existed in parallel and were merged at relevant points as we built towards our ultimate solution.

Our feature branches were **Dockerise** for Docker, **mysql** for MySQL, **Kubernetes** for Kubernetes and **Jenkins** for Jenkins.
As Terraform creates the infrastructure, **main.tf** was implemented on the main branch.
A **test** branch was configured for unit testing, in addition to an overarching **develop** branch to merge the changes into and act as a release pipeline.

![fbranch][fbranch]

As you can see, the features have been merged into the development branch, and the development branch merged into main as a release.
The test branch is not merged as it runs parallel to main for unit testing and does not contain new features.
